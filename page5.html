Ensure that all the ingredients are chopped, minced, and ready to go.
Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.
Add diced onions to the pan and saut√© until they become translucent.
Add minced garlic and stir-fry for about 30 seconds.
Add mixed vegetables and stir-fry until they are tender but still crisp.
Push the vegetables to one side of the pan, creating a space for the eggs.
Pour the beaten eggs into the cleared space. Allow them to set for a moment and then scramble them with a spatula until just cooked.
Mix the cooked eggs with the vegetables in the pan.
Addthe rice to the pan. Break up any clumps and mix well with the vegetables and eggs.
Drizzle soy sauce and sesame oil over the rice. Mix well until everything is evenly coated.
Season with salt and pepper to taste.
Add the cooked or diced chicken at this point and stir until heated through.
Garnish with chopped green onions.
